# An Android application manages Cloud Connector devices on ARTIK Cloud

Let's build an Android application that creates, authorizes, de-authorizes, and deletes [Cloud Connector](https://developer.artik.cloud/documentation/connect-the-data/using-cloud-connectors.html) devices from ARTIK Cloud.

The blog post Manage Cloud Connector device authentication within your application
(TODO at link to the blog post here....) at https://www.artik.io/blog/cloud/ describes what the app does and how to setup/install/implement it.
